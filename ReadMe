The main contributions of this paper include addressing
the critical issue of class imbalance in the dataset, which
affects the accuracy of human activity recognition models.
- To overcome this challenge, we employed three class
balancing techniques: SMOTE, LoRAS, and ProWRA.
- Our comprehensive evaluation of these methods across
multiple machine learning models highlights their potential in enhancing model performance. This study emphasizes the importance of addressing class imbalance for
effective human activity recognition.
